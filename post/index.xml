      <description>Nebraska’s defensive unit has not been consistent in Scott Frost’s tenure. While they improved slightly over the course of last year’s season, it hasn’t been a unit that’s been a deciding factor in the Big Ten Conference. If that is the case, then why has Nebraska been struggling on the defensive side of the ball? To find out, let’s look at the significance between the variable of defensive total turnovers (DefTotalTurnovers) is significant to the difference between what Nebraska’s total number of fumbles and interceptions were compared to their opponents all across the Big Ten Conference.</description>

      <description>Nebraska football and its fan base hasn’t had much to cheer about as of late. The last three seasons of Scott Frost’s tenure has only resulted in around three to four wins each season. While last years win record was an improvement to 4 wins overall, it doesn’t place Nebraska anywhere near the conversation when it comes to championships. However, people watching at home this season saw the defense improve, which gives the fans reason for hope.</description>

 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>
